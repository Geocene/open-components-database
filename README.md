# Open Component Database

This is an open database of components and circuit generators for automated circuit board design. Think of it as a software library for electrical engineering. We welcome contributions of component models, as well as parametric circuit generators. When you contricute to this library your expert hardware engineering knowledge becomes reusable and sharable, having the same impact as open-source software.

Components are modeled with the standardized open-source Embedded Systems Intermediate Representation (ESIR) developed by JITX for the national Electronic Resurgence Initiative.
